In this mode, changing the filenames in the right-hand job and then typing C-x C-s ("save") renames the indicated files. Renaming files is as easy as editing text. Batch renaming (e.g., renaming every file of the form icon_* to backup_icon_*) is as easy as performing a search and replace (M-x query-replace or M-%); there's no need to learn to use a separate batch renaming tool.

From within Emacs, you can interact with not just files and directories, but system utilities, compilers, debuggers, personal information managers, the web, email, chat, various other internet services, and more, and there's an ecosystem of third-party tools to make even more functionality accessible. Because of this integration, the benefits of learning to use any ofEmacs' editing features (say, search and replace) are multiplied many times oveer.
